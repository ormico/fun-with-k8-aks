# Fun with k8 and AKS

If you attended my talk at the Atlanta Code Camp 2019 entitled 'Fun with Kubernetes and AKS' this is where 
I will post the slides and examples that I presented, as well as some additional information that you might be interested in.

In the meantime, please take a look at the slide deck from my 2018 Atlanta Code Camp presentation 'Intro to deploying applications on Kubernete'. 
Many of the slides are the same.

If you 'Watch' this repository, Github will let you know when I make updates to the contents here.

Thank you for attending my talk.
